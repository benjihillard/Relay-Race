# Relay Race

## Generate quick race routes in your city.

Relay Race is a simple map-kit implementation to generate quick race routes for runners. Using location services we get the location of the phone. We chose public accessible coordinates at random locations within a radius of the user. Then created direction to the nodes in a random order. We then draw this path over the map. The user selects a radius based on how far they want to run and a number or checkpoints based on how intricate they want the route to be.
